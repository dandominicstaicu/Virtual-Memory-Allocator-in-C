## Virtual Memory Allocator - Homework 1

### Description:

* Virtual Memory Allocator's target is to simulate the bahviour of malloc() or
 calloc(), but also it takes care of freeing memory areas. It has 3 main
 components:
    1. An "arena" which contains a doubly linked list of blocks
    2. Blocks which each contain a doubly linked list of miniblocks
    3. Miniblocks which contain read/write buffers

* An user can 
    - alloc/dealloc the arena;
    - alloc/free blocks inside this arena;
    - read/write data inside the blocks;
    - print a representation of the memory inside the arena;

* ALLOC_ARENA:
    - init a memory a pointer to an empty list;
    - remember the size of the new arena;

* DEALLOC_ARENA:
    - free all the memory used by the blocks inside the arena;
    - free the arena pointer;

* ALLOC_BLOCK:
    - create a new miniblock inside the memory;
    - if the miniblock has no neighbors, it creates a new block;
    - if miniblock has neighbors, it sticks to them, enlarging the block;
    (if there is only one neighbor, it's block enlarges and eventually changes
    it's start address and size; if the new miniblock has neighbors on both
    sides, it's created a new block containing all the old miniblocks + the new
    one and the other 2 older neighbors are freed and deleted from the list);

* FREE_BLOCK:
    - free the miniblock at the given address;
    - if it's the only inside a block, remove it as well;
    - if there are more minis inside, resize the block, eventually break it in 2
    (this was done by allocing new blocks for each miniblock (but the deleted
    one), so they will merge as described in ALLOC_BLOCK);

* READ:
    - print the n bytes of data that is found at the given address;
    - if the address is not at the start of a miniblock/block, just start
      printing from the given address;
    - if the printing size is bigger than the area where is pointing, warn the
      user;
    - print only if miniblock's permissions allow it;
    - it reads from blocks, so the data can start inside a miniblock and
      continue in the next one;

* WRITE
    - write n bytes of data inside the miniblock at the given address;
    - if the address is not at the start of a miniblock/block, just start
      writing from the given address;
    - if the writing size is bigger than the area where is pointing, warn the
      user;
    - write only if miniblock's permissions allow it;
    - it reads from blocks, so the data can start inside a miniblock and
      continue in the next one;
    - the input can be on multiple lines, so the new data that has to be written
      is created inside this function and later copied into the memory area in
      the arena;

* PMAP
    - print a representation of how the memory inside the arena looks like;
    - represent it as blocks which contain miniblocks;
    - helps a lot on debugging;

* MPROTECT
    - set permissions on the miniblock's rw buffers;
    - use format RWX, similarly to files in linux;


### Comments about the homework:

I feel there are a few things that I could have implemented better, such as:

    * when reallocing the miniblocks in order to split up a bigger block, DEEP
    COPY was the way to go in order to copy the rw_buffer; for reasons of
    efficiency, I've decided to use only shallow copy, giving the new miniblock
    the old pointer to it's rw_buffer; because of that, I had to implement a
    different free for each case; 
        1. In case it was the last free of that miniblock (given by FREE_BLOCK
        or DEALLOC_ARENA), the memory of rw_buffer had to be freed as well;
        2. If the free wasn't final, but just a stage of reallocing miniblocks
        in ALLOC_BLOCK, I only freed the miniblocks and removed them from the
        list, but I kept the old rw_buffer memory area, as the new miniblock
        was still pointing to it;

    * I could get a better efficiency when searching for addresses, by
    exploiting the fact I use doubly linked lists; So, if a memory address was
    in the 2nd half of the arena, the VMA should start searching for it starting
    from the END of the block list;

    * I am still trying to figure out what is happening in tests 34-37

    * Maybe my writing an commenting could improve

During this homework I learned:

    * Using inttypes, which will be useful later because the network systems
    use this types. Char, int, long etc could differ in byte size from a system
    to another, but in networking we need accuracy; inttypes grants us the same
    data size on any system;

    * I am more familiar about working with pointers and dynamic memory; I got
    a better understanding about memory leaks, valgrind errors, why they
    occured and how to avoid them in future (or at least find them faster)

    * I got a better understanding about void* type and working with it in
    order to achieve generic functions and data structures
